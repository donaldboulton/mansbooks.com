                  Posted this on
                  <a href="http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2013-March/004589.html">
                    this on
                  </a>
                  in the Toybox mailing list on 13 March 2013 to introduce the
                  0BSD license which was subsequently adopted by the Toybox
                  project. Nobody but me is likely to care, but I'd like to
                  simplify the first paragraph from the current: Permission to
                  use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any
                  purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that
                  the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear
                  in all copies. To just say: Permission to use, copy, modify,
                  and / or distribute this software for any purpose with or
                  without fee is hereby granted. Reasoning: it was never my
                  intent to require anybody to copy license text into another
                  project if they cut and pasted something out of toybox. The
                  "permission for any purpose" is as close to public domain as
                  you can get in our current screwed up legal system without
                  making people uncomfortable the other way. Besides, my initial
                  reading of that was "all copies of the source code" but that's
                  not what it says, and somebody pointed out that Android has
                  "show license text" options because paranoid lawyers think
                  that sort of thing applies to the BINARY version, which is
                  nuts. I'm not changing it this release, but in case anybody
                  was going to object I thought I'd post it here for a bit first
                  so I can remove your code if it really matters to you. This
                  version is still outgoing-compatible with the old version code
                  that says the new thing can give code to a project that says
                  the old thing, whether it could receive it depends on how
                  paranoid your lawyers are. Rob
