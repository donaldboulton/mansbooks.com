                Angelina Jordan Astar was born and raised in Oslo, Norway; this
                world-renowned singer has earned fantastic reviews for the
                amazing breadth, depth and maturity of her vocal talent that
                simply belies her young age.

                  Amazingly, her passion for music began at just one-and- a-half
                  years of age when Angelina first saw Whitney Houston on
                  YouTube performing I Will Always Love You. Whitney - and later
                  Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington - became her first major
                  musical influences. At the age of seven, Angelina auditioned
                  for Norwayâ€™s Got Talent performing Billie Holidayâ€™s Gloomy
                  Sunday. She won the competition with the show drawing record
                  TV audiences.

              Angelinaâ€™s videos have received over several billions views on
              YouTube and more than 4 billion views on Facebook. Amazingly, her
              passion for music began at just one-and- a-half years of age when
              Angelina first saw Whitney Houston on YouTube performing I Will

              Not surprisingly, throughout her rising career, Angelina has
              featured in prominent media outlets including TIME, CNN, BBC, and
              People while also performing on the U.S. network TV shows Little
              Big Shots and The View.

              In 2016, Avicii chose Angelina for the vocals on his worldwide
              Volvo commercial campaign, a brilliant cover of Nina Simoneâ€™s
              Feeling Good.

              As well as singing before Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, charitable
              causes to which Angelina has given her talent include the
              Rainforest Alliance at the American Museum of Natural History in
              New York and Ein Herz fÃ¼r Kinder in Berlin where she helped raise
              over 21 Million Euros for children and families in need.

              This multi-talented singing prodigy has also written a successful,
              illustrated childrenâ€™s book in her native Norway making Angelina
              the youngest published author in the countryâ€™s history. Based on
              the true story of when she was six years old, Angelina met a
              homeless, shoeless girl. After they talked for a long time, she
              gave the girl her shoes and vowed never to appear on stage again
              wearing shoes until all the worldâ€™s children had them. Since that
              time, Angelina has always performed barefoot in public.
