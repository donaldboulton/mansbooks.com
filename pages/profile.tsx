              Born and raised in Oslo, Norway; this world-renowned singer has
              earned fantastic reviews for the amazing breadth, depth and
              maturity of her vocal talent that simply belies her young age.
              <div>
                Angelinaâ€™s videos have received over several billions views on
                YouTube and more than 4 billion views on Facebook.
              </div>
              <div>
                Amazingly, her passion for music began at just one-and- a-half
                years of age when Angelina first saw Whitney Houston on YouTube
                performing I Will Always Love You. Whitney - and later Billie
                Holiday, Dinah Washington - became her first major musical
                influences.
              </div>
              <div>
                At the age of seven, Angelina auditioned for Norwayâ€™s Got Talent
                performing Billie Holidayâ€™s Gloomy Sunday. She won the
                competition with the show drawing record TV audiences.
              </div>
              <div>
                Not surprisingly, throughout her rising career, Angelina has
                featured in prominent media outlets including TIME, CNN, BBC,
                and People while also performing on the U.S. network TV shows
                Little Big Shots and The View.
              </div>
              <div>
                In 2016, Avicii chose Angelina for the vocals on his worldwide
                Volvo commercial campaign, a brilliant cover of Nina Simoneâ€™s
                Feeling Good.
              </div>
              <div>
                As well as singing before Nobel Peace Prize Laureates,
                charitable causes to which Angelina has given her talent include
                the Rainforest Alliance at the American Museum of Natural
                History in New York and Ein Herz fÃ¼r Kinder in Berlin where she
                helped raise over 21 Million Euros for children and families in
                need.
              </div>
              <div>
                This multi-talented singing prodigy has also written a
                successful, illustrated childrenâ€™s book in her native Norway
                making Angelina the youngest published author in the countryâ€™s
                history.
              </div>
              Based on the true story of when she was six years old, Angelina
              met a homeless, shoeless girl. After they talked for a long time,
              she gave the girl her shoes and vowed never to appear on stage
              again wearing shoes until all the worldâ€™s children had them. Since
              that time, Angelina has always performed barefoot in public.
