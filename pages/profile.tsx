            Born and raised in Oslo, Norway; this world-renowned singer has
            earned fantastic reviews for the amazing breadth, depth and maturity
            of her vocal talent that simply belies her young age.
            <p>
              Angelinaâ€™s videos have received over several billions views on
              YouTube and more than 4 billion views on Facebook.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amazingly, her passion for music began at just one-and- a-half
              years of age when Angelina first saw Whitney Houston on YouTube
              performing I Will Always Love You. Whitney - and later Billie
              Holiday, Dinah Washington - became her first major musical
              influences.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the age of seven, Angelina auditioned for Norwayâ€™s Got Talent
              performing Billie Holidayâ€™s Gloomy Sunday. She won the competition
              with the show drawing record TV audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not surprisingly, throughout her rising career, Angelina has
              featured in prominent media outlets including TIME, CNN, BBC, and
              People while also performing on the U.S. network TV shows Little
              Big Shots and The View.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2016, Avicii chose Angelina for the vocals on his worldwide
              Volvo commercial campaign, a brilliant cover of Nina Simoneâ€™s
              Feeling Good.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as singing before Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, charitable
              causes to which Angelina has given her talent include the
              Rainforest Alliance at the American Museum of Natural History in
              New York and Ein Herz fÃ¼r Kinder in Berlin where she helped raise
              over 21 Million Euros for children and families in need.
            </p>
            <p>
              This multi-talented singing prodigy has also written a successful,
              illustrated childrenâ€™s book in her native Norway making Angelina
              the youngest published author in the countryâ€™s history.
            </p>
            Based on the true story of when she was six years old, Angelina met
            a homeless, shoeless girl. After they talked for a long time, she
            gave the girl her shoes and vowed never to appear on stage again
            wearing shoes until all the worldâ€™s children had them. Since that
            time, Angelina has always performed barefoot in public.
