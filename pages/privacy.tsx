        <h2>Analytics Cookie Types</h2>
        <Section>
          <div>- \_\_utma</div>
          ü§ö This cookie is used to determine new and returning visitors. It has
          an expiration time of 2 years. If the ga.js library is executed and no
          \_utma cookie exists, this will be recorded as the users‚Äô first visit
          and a \_utma cookie will be set. If a \_utma cookie is already in
          place, the expiration time is reset and the user is recorded as a
          return visitor.
          <div>- \_\_utmb</div>
          ü§ö This cookie is used to determine a new session. The cookie is set
          when the ga.js library executes and there is no \_utmb cookie in
          place. It has an expiration time of 30 minutes, therefore if a user is
          inactive for a period longer than this, a new cookie will be set when
          the library executes and the interaction will be recorded as a new
          session.
          <div>- \_\_utmz</div>
          ü§ö This cookie is used to determine the traffic source, medium,
          campaign name and campaign term which delivered the user to your
          website. It is created when the javaScript library executes and
          expires after 6 months. This helps Google collect the data which can
          then help them to determine which traffic sources assist conversions
          within the multi-channel section of Analytics.
          <div>- \_\_utmc</div>
          ü§ö This Cookie waits 30 minutes, and then it expires. You see,
          \_\_utmc has no way of knowing when a user closes their browser or
          leaves a website, so it waits 30 minutes for another pageview to
          happen, and if it doesn‚Äôt, it expires. And is used to store
          information, such as what time your current visit occurred, whether
          you have been to the site before, and what site referred you to the
          web page.

          <div>
            ü§ö This cookie is used for storing visitor-level custom variable
            data. It is created when the \_setCustomVar method is used with a
            visitor level custom variable. Like the \_utma cookie, this cookie
            expires after 2 years and is reset each time the user visits your
            site before the expiration of the cookie.
          </div>
          Although each of these cookies has a set expiration time, each time
          the ga.js library is executed and the expiration time has not been met
          the cookie is updated, resetting the expiration date to its original
          value.

          üòú In order to provide website visitors with more choice on how data
          is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google
          Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the
          Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to stop data being sent to Google
          Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not affect
          usage of the website in any other way. A link to further information
          on the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on is provided below for
          your convenience.
